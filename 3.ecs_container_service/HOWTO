1. Fix docker.service start fail:
- Disable SELinux (/etc/sysconfig/selinux --> SELINUX=disabled)

2. "aws configure" before using AWSCLI:
- Login to "https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/users/xbaotha?section=security_credentials"
(get information about login credentials)

3. Getting knowledge about containter/task/service/cluster
---> https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-west-2#/firstRun


4. Supervisord
Usages: tools for starting and monitoring multiple processes/application with just one configuration.
        --> applicable for starting multiple process with container Dockerfile.
