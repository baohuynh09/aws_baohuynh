#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#  COMPLETE STEPS for remote access of MySQL (deployed on Amazon EC2) #
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#

1. Add MySQL to inbound rules.
Go to security group of your ec2 instance -> edit inbound rules -> add new rule -> choose MySQL/Aurora (open port 3306) and source to Anywhere.

2. (Optional) Add bind-address = 0.0.0.0 to my.cnf
On database server:
sudo vi /etc/my.cnf --> add this line: 
bind-address = 0.0.0.0

Restart MySQL --> systemctl restart mariadb

3. Create a remote user and grant privileges.
Login to MySQL in database server:
mysql -u root

Now write following commands:

CREATE USER 'baohuynh'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'baohuynhpassword';

CREATE USER 'baohuynh'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'baohuynhpassword';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* to baohuynh@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'baohuynhpassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* to baohuynh@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'baohuynhpassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

EXIT;

---> DONE

4. After this, MySQL dB can be remotely accessed by entering public dns/ip of your instance as MySQL Host Address, username as baohuynh and password as baohuynhpassword. (Port is set to default at 3306)
On remote working machine: 
mysql -u baohuynh -h <dns_database_server> -p
-u : user
-h : hostname
-p : prompting for password
